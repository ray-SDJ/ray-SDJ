- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ray-SDJ -Rayner Soto De Jesus
Software engineer with a bottomless curiosity for the mysteries of code. I believe the best way to create is to keep learning, so I'm always exploring new frontiers in tech. My missionis to push the boundaries of what's possible, bit by bit. Join me on my journey to revolutionize the digital landscape - brace yourself for some serious innovation! I am always seeking out new skills and tools to add to my arsenal, like a digital tinkerer armed with code instead of screwdrivers.
